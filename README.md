# Binaural
A showcase for the binaural audio using [Head Related Transform Functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function) (HRTF). This projects uses Web Audio API for audio and three.js for graphics.
NOTE: This works only for **headphones.** 

## Info
Creating binaural sound by panning a sound source using HRTF allows to position the sound in the 3D space with realistic results that can't be achieved using other techniques.

Since each every human's head is geometrically different, different HRTFs gives worse or better results for different people. Here You can choose (in real-time) from 45 different HRTFs from [CIPIC Database](http://interface.cipic.ucdavis.edu/sound/hrtf.html)
